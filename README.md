# Codewars Setup

Personalized version of [VailColorado13's Codewars Autowriter](https://github.com/VailColorado13/codewars-autowriter).  

**Note: this is my personal version. If you want to use it, you will have to customize the file paths in `index.js` and `src/fs.js`**  

Pass it a Codewars URL, and it will setup a folder "#KYU/NAME" with two files: solution.js and solution.test.js.  
For example, https://www.codewars.com/kata/54ff0d1f355cfd20e60001fc/javascript creates:  
* `codewars/7kyu/factorial/solution.js`
* `codewars/7kyu/factorial/solution.test.js`  

The contents of these files need to be changed to match the Codewars exercise.
